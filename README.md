# ‚ö° Fix Auto Scroll Neovim

**fix-auto-scroll** is a lua plugin for Neovim that changes the default behavior in Neovim when switching between buffers. By default in Neovim when you switch to another buffer and get back to the previous buffer the cursor's line number is preserved but that line number is positioned in the middle of the screen vertically. 
This plugin is based on the idea exposed in this [post](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_scrolling_when_switch_buffers).
